## About the Project
### Description
Hi! Welcome to the ultimate áˆ‹yá‰¥Raáˆª, library for local library users and book lovers. This is a complete guide about the project of áˆ‹yá‰¥Raáˆª. Briefly speaking, this is an app for reserving books while sitting and relaxing at your home. Sounds interseting? I will take you to a journey, from the idea conception all the way to the deployment, my inspirations and the technologies I used. Buckle up and let's hit the notes ðŸ˜Š.
### Targets
Simply this app is for Students, Teachers, Professors or any one who loves and reads books. Have you ever went to a library seeking to read or borrow a  book, but went back home disappointed the book you are looking is not available. Or Have you ever spend your day working or learning and did not get the chance to go to a library and reserve a book for your study. Say good bye to those problems. This app will help you solve problems related with book reserving issues.
### UIUX Designs
> I used some imaginary characters (Persona) to consider people with different background, gender, occupations, etc...
> And I tried to set the problem and user experience with User Journey Map, User Story and Problem Statement.
> Before starting to build anything, I sketch how the web should look like using paper wireframe and Low Fidelity Prototype using Figma.
> I did usability study on three people and after improving based on the feedbacks, I created case study for the project.
### CICD Workflow
> I used CircleCI for my countinuous integration and continuous deployment
